Terraform Provider Development Kit

DISCLAIMER: The author primarily works on the [AzureRM Provider](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm) so this tool is *heavily* biased towards the code styles and requirements of that provider currently.  Future development will look to genericise the output (eventually ðŸ˜œ) 
 
NOTE: Expects to be run from the root of a validly named Terraform provider e.g. `./terraform-provider-myprovider`

NOTE: Relies on a locally installed terraform binary and appropriately configured [dev overrides file](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/config/config-file.html#development-overrides-for-provider-developers). This 
allows the Terraform binary to skip the `init` step by informing it where your compiled provider binary can be found. (you still currently need a local .tf file with your [provider configured](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/providers/configuration.html) though, sorry!)

Run from the root of the provider project.

## TODO
- [x] untyped resource template
- [x] `go fmt` outputs
- [x] Add new resources / data sources to appropriate registration
- [x] typed and untyped Data Sources
- [x] init a new provider - git clone [scaffold](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-scaffolding)?
- [ ] optionally populate the Typed SDK into the init step? 
- [x] Dynamically read provider name for item generation
- [ ] Populate `IDValidationFunc()` in template for IDs (Pandora)
- [ ] Clients?
- [ ] Autocomplete CLI?
- [x] Spike doc generation 
- [ ] Extend doc gen to deal with Blocks
- [ ] migrate to ~~plugin sdk~~ something else to read schema directly for doc gen as Terraform's JSON output lacks necessary detail. (e.g. timeouts, ForceNew flags etc)
- [x] update commands and templates to allow non-hashicorp providers ~~and sources other than github~~ (e.g. import paths)


## Commands

Usage: `tfpdk [--version] [--help] <command> [<args>]`

```
Available commands are:
config            Generate a local config file for common options.  
datasource        creates boiler-plate Data Sources.  
document          generates documentation from a resource.  
init              initialises a new provider based on the scaffold project.  
resource          creates boiler-plate resources.  
servicepackage    Creates a directory for a new Service Package and scaffolds out the basics to use it.  
```

## Usage Examples

### Create a Typed Data Source for an existing Resource where the Resource's model is appropriate for use in the Data Source
```shell
tfpdk datasource -name ShinyNewService -servicepackage SomeCloudService -typed -useresourcemodel
```
Will create the following path `{providername}/internal/services/SomeCloudService/shiny_new_service_data_source.go`

### Create an un-typed (traditional) resource 
```shell
tfpdk resource -name ShinyNewService -servicepackage SomeCloudService
```
Will create the following path `{providername}/internal/services/SomeCloudService/shiny_new_service_resource.go`
and update `registration.go` with the new resource in the `SupportedResources()` func e.g. 

```go
func (r Registration) SupportedResources() map[string]*pluginsdk.Resource {
	return map[string]*pluginsdk.Resource{
		"azurerm_shiny_new_service": resourceShinyNewService(),
	}
}
```

### Create a typed updatable resource 
```shell
tfpdk resource -name ShinyNewService -servicepackage SomeCloudService -has-update -typed
```
Will create the following path `{providername}/internal/services/SomeCloudService/shiny_new_service_resource.go`
and update `registration.go` with the new resource in the `Resources()` func, e.g.
```go
func (r Registration) Resources() []sdk.Resource {
	return []sdk.Resource{
		ShinyNewServiceResource{},
	}
}
```

### Document your new resource (relies on the `Description` fields in your schema, so populate those for best effect)
```shell
tfpdk document -type resource -name ShinyNewService -id "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
```

### Generate a Local config to set options and paths

```shell
tfpdk config
```
will create `.tfpdk.hcl` in the root of the provider, which can be updated to configure provider specifics that may differ from the defaults. (by "defaults", I mean what we use on AzureRM), example output:

```
provider_name                   = "azurerm"
service_packages_path           = "internal/services"
provider_github_org             = "hashicorp"
docs_path                       = "docs"
resource_docs_directory_name    = "r"
data_source_docs_directory_name = "d"
use_typed_sdk                   = false
```

**Note:** Command line options override values from the config file.
